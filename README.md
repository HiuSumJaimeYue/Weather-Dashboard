# Weather-Dashboard

This is a weather dashboard made by Hiu Sum Jaime Yue.    

In this weather dashboard web application, you can type in a city name, click the search button and see the weather information of that city.              

After you clicked the Search button, the weather information of the requested city will show on the right side of the web application. You can see the current weather conditions and the 5 days forecast for that city. The information will include city name, the date, an icon representation of weather condition, the temperature, the wind speed and the humidity. For the current weather condition, it will also include the UV index. The UV index will show in a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. Favorable is in green, which the UV index is 0 - 2. Moderate is in yellow, which the UV index is 3 - 5. Severe is in red, which the UV index is more than 6.      

You can also see the search history below the Search button. If the requested city was never been searched before and successfully searched, a button with that city name will be there. You can just click on the button and the web application will show you the weather conditions for that city. If you refresh the page, you can still see the search history city button and click on as a shortcut for showing the weather conditions.
